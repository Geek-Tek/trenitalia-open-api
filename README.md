# Trenitalia open API

### A npm package aimed to make Trenitalia closed API more accessible.

Query and gather info about trains and the Trenitalia traffic situation.

With Trenitalia open API, you can build your own train visualizer and real time monitor system.

<br/>

You can download the package from [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trenitalia-open-api) or find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Geek-Tek/trenitalia-open-api 'trenitalia-open-api') and help me there.

Something useful to develop further could be:
- npm documentation
- more typescript types
- more ViaggiaTreno API access point implemented

<br/>

This project is not meant to help users find travel solutions or manage tickets, but are mainly aimed to gather informations and monitor Trenitalia's traffic situation.

For this reason, the implemented functions should be used to gather and store the necessary information in a DB.

### Please, be kind and be respectful with Trenitalia's/FS' servers
